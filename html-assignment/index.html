        <h2>About me</h2>

        <p>
          Hi! I am from the beautiful country of the <em>Philippines</em>. I
          enjoy playing <em>football</em>. When nostalgia sets in, I casually
          strum the strings of my <em>guitar</em>. Music holds a special place
          in my heart and I love listening to various genres. Whether it's
          reggae on the beach, alternative rock while driving, Mozart for
          relaxation, or the familiar tunes of "Baby Shark" and nursery rhymes
          when I'm with my son, music adds colors to my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          During the summer months, I love cruising on my <em>bike</em>,
          exploring the outdoors, and soaking in the warmth of the sun. When
          stress creeps in, <em>walking or jogging </em>is my escape. In terms
          of gaming, I prefer <abbr title="Role-Playing Games">RPGs</abbr> that
          allow me to proceed at my own pace, such as
          <abbr title="God of War">GOW</abbr>,
          <abbr title="Final Fantasy 7">FFVII</abbr>, and
          <abbr title="The Witcher 3">W3</abbr>. As a husband and a father, my
          responsibilities take priority. Parenting a lively toddler adds a
          delightful layer to my life although challenging, it also fills my
          days with laughter and joy.
        </p>
