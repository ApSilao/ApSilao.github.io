            <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>
                Hi! I am from the beautiful country of the Philippines. I enjoy playing football. When I feel nostalgic, I casually strum the strings of my guitar. Music holds a special place in my heart, and I like to listen to  music. Whether it's reggae on the beach, alternative rock while driving, Mozart for sleeping, or the repeating tunes of "Baby Shark" and nursery rhymes when I'm with my son, 
                music adds color to life.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the summer months, I love cruising on my bike, exploring the outdoors, and soaking in the warmth of the sun. When stress creeps in, walking or jogging is my escape. In terms of gaming, I prefer RPGs that allow me to proceed at my own pace, such as GOW (God of War), FFVII (Final Fantasy 7), and W3 (The Witcher 3). As a husband and a father, responsibilities take priority. Parenting a lively toddler adds a delightful layer to my life although challenging, it also fills my days with laughter and joy.

            </p>

                5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart
                and lean not on your own understanding;
                6 in all your ways acknowledge him,
                and he shall direct your path.

                <cite> Proverbs 3:5-6</cite>
